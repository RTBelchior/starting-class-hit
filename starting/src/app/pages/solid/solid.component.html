      <h2>Origin of SOLID</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>SOLID</strong> principles were introduced by <strong>Robert C. Martin</strong>, also known as Uncle Bob, 
        in the early 2000s. These five design principles aim to make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
      </p>
 
      <h2>Why Use SOLID?</h2>
      <p>The following Firebase services are commonly used in Angular projects:</p>
 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improves Code Quality:</strong> Encourages good design practices and clean architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces Coupling:</strong> Makes components more independent and easier to test or modify.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhances Maintainability:</strong> Easier to update or extend code without breaking existing functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotes Reusability:</strong> SOLID designs tend to create smaller, reusable components.</li>
      </ul>
 
      <h2>The Five Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Angular provides a structured, component-based framework that aligns well with Firebase’s reactive, real-time services.
        This synergy allows you to:

      <ul>
        1. <strong>S</strong> - Single Responsibility Principle
        2. <strong>O</strong> - Open/Closed Principle
        3. <strong>L</strong> - Liskov Substitution Principle
        4. <strong>I</strong> - Interface Segregation Principle
        5. <strong>D</strong> - Dependency Inversion Principle
      </ul>
